# epr-regulator-enrolment-frontend
 
## Overview
EPR RPD Regulator Enrolment is an ASP.NET Core web application, that is to create organisation account for each of four nations' regulatory bodies, as well as to get one of two initial persions enrolled for each body as an admin user, so they will be able to start inviting other people to enroll.
This web application will be decommissioned as soon as all regulatory bodies's accounts are created and their initial admin users have enrolled.
